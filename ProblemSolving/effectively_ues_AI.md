# 🚀 Efficiently Solving LeetCode Problems with AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude)

In the era of AI, smart programmers use tools like **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, **Claude**, and **Perplexity** to **enhance learning, not shortcut it**.

---

## 🧠 AI-Powered LeetCode Workflow

### ✅ 1. Understand the Problem (Use AI as a Mentor)
> **Goal:** Grasp the question deeply before writing code.

**Ask AI:**
- “Can you explain this LeetCode problem in simple terms?”
- “What kind of input/output and constraints should I watch for?”
- “Can you list potential edge cases?”

**Tools:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude

---

### 🪜 2. Try It Yourself First
> **Goal:** Give your brain a workout. Learning happens through effort.

- Attempt the problem for 20–30 minutes.
- Use pen/paper or code editor.
- If stuck, **don’t get the full solution right away.**

---

### 💡 3. Use AI for Hints and Ideas (Not Full Code Yet)
> Ask AI like a coach, not like a code machine.

**Prompt Examples:**
- “What approach could I try for this problem?”
- “Is this problem similar to any known pattern?”
- “What data structures might help here?”

**Tools:** ChatGPT (great for strategy), Gemini (if you want Google-style results)

---

### 🔍 4. Get Feedback on Your Code
> You’ve written code, now ask AI to review and optimize.

**Ask:**
- “Can you review this code and suggest improvements?”
- “Why is this getting Time Limit Exceeded?”
- “How can I reduce time/space complexity?”

**Tools:** Claude (great for deep code review), ChatGPT

---

### 📈 5. Compare with Optimal Solution & Learn Patterns
> Learn *why* the best solution works, not just *what* it is.

**Ask AI:**
- “What’s the optimal solution and why?”
- “What is the time and space complexity?”
- “What’s the name of the algorithmic pattern used here?”

**Tools:** ChatGPT, Perplexity (if you want links to external blogs, articles, discussions)

---

### 🧩 6. Build a Pattern Map
> Use AI to help categorize problems:

**Ask:**
- “Give me 5 problems similar to this using the same pattern.”
- “What are common dynamic programming problems on LeetCode?”
- “Show me a roadmap for learning sliding window problems.”

**Tools:** ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity

---

### 🎯 7. Simulate Mock Interviews with AI
> Practice real-world interview pressure.

**Ask:**
- “Act as an interviewer. Give me a medium-level LeetCode problem.”
- Solve it.
- Ask for review and feedback.

**Tools:** ChatGPT, Claude

## 🔄 Sample Workflow with ChatGPT

```text
🔹 Step 1: Paste the problem
🔹 Step 2: Ask: “Explain this problem in simple terms.”
🔹 Step 3: Try yourself
🔹 Step 4: If stuck, ask: “Give me a hint.”
🔹 Step 5: After solving, ask:
     - “Can you review my code?”
     - “Is there a more optimal solution?”
     - “What’s the pattern here?”
```

# 🚫 Avoid These Traps
|🚫 Mistake	         |   ✅ Better Way|
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Copy-pasting solutions | Use AI to learn step-by-step|
|Skipping thought process|	Think first, then ask|
|Overusing AI as a crutch|	Use it to learn, not just finish|

# 🧠 Summary
| Step            |	Purpose      |	AI Role          |
