# ⚡ How to Efficiently Solve LeetCode Problems Using AI Tools
## 🧠 1. Understand the Problem First
   - Don't ask for the solution right away. Try to understand what the problem is asking.
   - Use AI to clarify confusing parts:
      - "Can you explain what this problem is asking in simple terms?"
      - "What are the constraints and edge cases I should consider here?"
## 🪜 2. Get Step-by-Step Hints
Instead of asking "give me the solution," ask:
- "Give me a hint for this problem."
- "What data structure might be suitable for this?"
- "Should I use recursion or iteration here?"
💡 Why? This keeps your brain engaged and builds problem-solving skills while still getting AI guidance.

## 🛠️ 3. Review and Debug Your Own Code
paste your code and ask:
- "What wrong with this code?"
- "Why is this giving Time Limit Exceeded?"
- "Can you help me optimize this?"
✅ Tools like ChatGPT or Claude can help spot edge cases, optimize complexity, and rewrite cleaner code.

## 🔁 4. Compare Your Solution with the Optimal One
Once you've solved (or tried hard):
- Ask AI to show the **optimal solution**
- Then ask:
   - "Can you explain why this solution is better?"
   - "What is the time and space complexity?"

📊 This builds intuition around efficiency and helps you improve your thinking patterns.

## 🎯 5. Simulate Interviews
   - Ask: "Can you give me a mock LeetCode-style interviw?"
   - The AI can:
     - Pose a problem
     - Wait for your explanation
     - Review your thought process and code
     - Act like an interviewer
  
🤖 This helps build real interview confidence and timing.

## 📘 6. Learn Patterns, Not Just Solutions
   - Ask AI:
      - "What type of problem is this (e.g., sliding window, backtracking)?"
      - What are common patterns to solve similar problems?"
  
🔁 Learn patterns like:
   - Two pointers
   - BFS/DFS
   - Dynamic programming
   - Binary search on answer

This is how top candidates get faster and more efficient.
## ⛔ What Not to Do

|❌ Wrong Approach                          | ✅ Better Alternative                         |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Copy-pasting full solutions                | Ask for hints or explanation first            |
|Using AI for every problem from the start  | Try first, fail fast, then ask for help       |
|Not understanding the AI's solution        | Ask why it works and how to optimize it       |
|Relying only on ChatGPT                    | Compare outputs from multiple tools if unsure |


## ⚔️ Which Tool to Use When?
|Tool               | Strengths                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|**ChatGPT(GPT-4)** | Best for reasoning, explaining, step-by-step breakdown    |
| **Gemini**        | Good for google-integrated queries, visual explanations   |
| **Claude**        | Excellent at long reasoning and safe explanations         |
| **Perplexity**    | Fast research + short summary with sources                |

## 🚀 Final Strategy
1. Try for 15-30 minutes yourself.
2. Use AI for hints, not direct answers.
3. Discuss your solution with AI.
4. Review optimal solutions.
5. Document your learnings and patterns.
